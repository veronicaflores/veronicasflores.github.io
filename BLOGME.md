## Week 1 (June 27th - July 1st)

**June 27th:** <br/>    
I began my research this week in person where I met with Professor Vicente Ordóñez Román and we went over onboarding tasks and started to figure
out a more specific project that I would be working on this summer. Initially we discussed three different topics: vision+language generation, 
image bias removal and analysis, image and text retrieval. However, we found that starting with bias removal and analysis would be a good
start. 

The first machine learning model introduced was the [CLIP Model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/):

Here is the link to the CLIP Model article used: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf
- The CLIP Model uses both image and text retrieval.

Moreover, we looked at different research articles regarding image or text biases in machine learning models. 

The **[first article](https://uclanlp.github.io/corefBias/overview)** was regarding text biases. The [WinoBias](https://github.com/uclanlp/corefBias/tree/master/WinoBias/wino) 
dataset addressed the problem of conference systems exhibiting gender bias. In order to evaluate the biases they created a new challenge corpus, WinoBias, 
to show if the different systems where gender biased through the use of pronouns and different occupations.

The **[second article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08489)** was regarding image biases. The problem addressed was that in visual recognition tasks 
such systems using images containing people allow the risk of amplifying societal stereotypes. The social stereotypes addressed where
gender (and race, or age). They stated that the model tested exhibited bias amplification if it leaked more info about gender than a classifier 
of equivalent accuracy.

The articles I read where to familiarize myself with machine learning models, image and/or text retriaval, and bias removal and analysis.
